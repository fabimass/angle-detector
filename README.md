# angle-detector
The project consists of the development of a system that allows measuring the angle regarding to the horizontal using the reading of an accelerometer. The desired inclination can be programmable via keyboard, and a buzzer will sound when the level is achieved.

The processing is carried out with a LPC1769 microcontroller from the Cortex-M3 family, using FreeRTOS as the operating system.
